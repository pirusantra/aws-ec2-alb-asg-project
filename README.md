# Project 1: Scalable Web Application with ALB and Auto Scaling

This project serves a static web page from Amazon EC2 instances. The infrastructure is designed to be resilient and to handle varying levels of traffic by automatically adjusting the number of instances based on demand.

# Technologies Used
HTML: The front-end of the application.

AWS EC2: Virtual servers running the application.

AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming web traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

AWS Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Automatically scales the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic demand and health checks.

AWS Route 53: A scalable cloud DNS service that routes user requests to the ALB.

AWS CloudWatch: A monitoring service that collects metrics used by the ASG for scaling decisions
